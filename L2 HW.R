#question 1 Compute the difference between this year (2025) and the year you started at the university and divide this by the difference between this year and the year you were born. Multiply this with 100 to get the percentage of your life you have spent at the university.

current_year = 2025
admission_year = 2019
birth_year = 2001

answer1 = (current_year - admission_year)/(current_year - birth_year) * 100
answer1



#Make different kinds of variables and vectors with the data types we learned together.
#variables
x = 5
y = 10.0
z = 13.4

#characters
vector_number = c(1, 2, 2, 3, 5)
vector_character = c("xyz", "abc", "mno")
vector_float = c(2.34, 10, 5.657)
